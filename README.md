# Redux Collections

This project was created with study purposes.

## API:

At this project i've used both the Rick and Morty API (https://rickandmortyapi.com/) and the pokemons API (https://pokeapi.co/), 
also choose axios library to do our HTTP requisitions.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to require some data from both APIs and treat it around my app.
At the time of it's development I wasnt learned Redux already so I've used the components heritage to handle the lists.

Feel free to enjoy.
